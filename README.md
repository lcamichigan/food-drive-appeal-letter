The text of the letter is intended for a fall food drive. Here is text that
could be used to introduce a Watermelon Bust:

> I’m happy to announce Sigma’s next Watermelon Bust! The Watermelon Bust is a
> competitive food drive among University of Michigan Greek organizations
> starting on Month ## and culminating in a day of watermelon-related fun and
> games at the chapter house on Month ##. We will donate the nonperishable food
> and monetary gifts we collect to Food Gatherers, a local food bank and member
> of ΛΧΑ’s philanthropy partner Feeding America. Learn more about Food Gatherers
> from its website at foodgatherers.org.
